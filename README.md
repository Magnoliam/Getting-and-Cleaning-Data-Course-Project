# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

Introduction

This repository contains my work for the Getting and Cleaning data course project. 

Contents

•	CodeBook.md - Describes the experiment data and the steps taken to summarize the data.

•	run_analysis.R - R script to merge, clean-up, transform, and summarize the experiment data.

•	tidy-UCI-HAR-dataset-AVG.txt - Output file generated by the run_analysis.R script.

•	README.md - This file.

About the script

I created a script called run_analysis.R which will merge the test and training sets together. Prerequisites for this script:

1.	the UCI HAR Dataset must be extracted and.

2.	the UCI HAR Dataset must be availble in a directory called "UCI HAR Dataset"

After merging testing and training, labels are added and only columns that have to do with mean and standard deviation are kept.
Lastly, the script will create a tidy data set containing the means of all the columns per test subject and per activity. 

About the tidy dataset

The tidy-UCI-HAR-dataset-AVG.txt, is a 180x68 data table (181 with column name), whereas before, the first column contains subject IDs, the second column contains activity names, and then the averages for each of the 66 attributes are in columns 3...68. There are 30 subjects and 6 activities, thus 180 rows in this data set with averages.

About the Code Book

The CodeBook.md file explains the transformations performed and the resulting data and variables.
